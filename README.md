Hi there!

![alt-text](./profilePic.jpg)

I’m a Computer Science and Math major at Columbia University interested in a career in software engineering, data science, and machine learning. I'm especially interested in the intersections of computer science and economics, and I have a passion for applying my technical skills to public policy. I’ve created this page to compile my personal projects. Thank you for checking it out!
